#### Problem this project is solving
My family plays "FamLeague" every year, but it takes a lot of time to write everything out and send everyone updates. With this website everyone can create their own team line up, check their scores and have the ability to see who's winning without having to wait.
#### Libraries/Frameworks
- Django
- Beautiful Soup
- Materialize
- Bootstrap

## User Walkthrough
- login/register
- pick teams from columns A, B, C, D (ensure no one has the same team line up)
- check your teams score/points
- know the rules/points system (text)
- check leaderboard to see who is winning
- talk to other users (trash talk section) Chatboard/bulletin board

## Data Model
- Users
- Store all football teams
- Store all scores
- Store Tiebreaker teams
- Association of 4 user teams between all teams
- Store messages for chatroom

## Schedule

- Registration, Rules Boolean
#### Week 2

#### Future features
